body:

    attributes:
      value: "### Thanks for helping improve our codebase! Refactoring improves code quality without changing its external behavior."

  - type: textarea
    id: code-location
    attributes:
      label: "1. Which part of the code needs refactoring?"
      description: "Please list the relevant files, modules, classes, or functions."
      placeholder: |
        - src/components/UserProfile.js
        - The entire `calculateOrderTotal` function in `src/utils/cart.js`
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: refactor-reason
    attributes:
      label: "2. Why does this code need to be refactored?"
      description: "Describe the current problem. Is the code hard to read, inefficient, difficult to test, or overly complex (i.e., technical debt)?"
      placeholder: "The UserProfile component has too much state logic, making it hard to follow and test. It mixes data fetching with UI rendering."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed-improvement
    attributes:
      label: "3. What is the proposed improvement?"
      description: "Describe the desired state of the code after the refactor. This should be a high-level plan."
      placeholder: "Extract the state logic and data fetching into a custom React hook (e.g., `useUserProfile`). The component should then only be responsible for rendering."
    validations:
      required: true

      description: "How will we confirm that the refactor was successful and didn't introduce any new bugs?"
      options:
        - label: "All existing unit/integration tests for this area must pass."
          required: true
        - label: "The related feature will be manually tested to confirm behavior is unchanged."
