# Core Components

## UI Manager

**Responsibilities:**

- Accepts user input.
- Displays the code execution stream.
- Displays Gemini's response stream.

**Notes:**

- Must maintain consistent styling.
- Should expose callable functions with well-defined data structures.

## Input Router

**Responsibilities:**

- Parses user input to determine whether it is a prompt (to be forwarded to the Prompt Engine) or a direct command (to be forwarded to the Execution Engine).

## Execution Engine

**Responsibilities:**

- Executes shell commands directly.

**Notes:**

- Returns output as a stream.

## Prompt Engine

**Responsibilities:**

- Formats prompts with system instructions and session memory.
- Initiates LLM calls.

**Notes:**

- LLM and tool configurations must be managed here.

## Session Memory

**Responsibilities:**

- Tracks input and output from direct user interactions with the Execution Engine.
- Tracks input and output from user and Execution Engine interactions with the LLM model.

**Notes:**

- Must adhere to the data structure specified in Gemini's documentation.
- Should implement a maximum threshold to discard very old session data.

## History Filter

**Responsibilities:**

- Determines whether direct interactions between the user and the Execution Engine should be stored in session memory.

## Output Processor

**Responsibilities:**

- Parses the output generated by the Execution Engine before passing it to the LLM.
