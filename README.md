## About The Project

<div align="center">
  <img src="./assets/image1.svg" alt="Footer Banner" width="100%" style="max-width: 1200px;">
</div>

An innovative terminal experience designed to boost developer productivity by integrating modern AI directly into the command-line workflow.

**Core Philosophy:**

- **Dual-Mode Interaction:** Freely switch between executing precise shell commands (e.g., `git push`) and having a natural language conversation with an LLM that understands your context.
- **Context-Aware History:** The terminal remembers the output of your commands, allowing you to ask follow-up questions like "Why did that last command fail?"
- **Extensible Toolset:** The AI isn't limited to the shell. The architecture is designed for future "tools," allowing the agent to interact with the file system (v2) and browse the web (v3).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and UV installed on your system.

- Install UV:
  ```sh
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

- ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/aditsuru-git/prism-terminal.git
  cd prism-terminal
  ```

2. Install the required Python packages using UV:

- ```sh
  uv sync
  ```

3. Set up your environment variables by copying the sample file:

- ```sh
  cp .env.sample .env
  ```

4. Run the app:

- ```sh
  uv run -m src.main
  ```

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> Prism Terminal is in active development. Expect frequent updates and possible instability.
>
> <span style="color:red">Always review the commands generated by the AI before executing them.</span>

## Roadmap

We have an exciting roadmap ahead, transforming Prism from a smart terminal into a full-fledged agent.

- MVP: basic command execution and AI integration
- v2: Filesystem Agent Capabilities (read/write files)
- v3: Web Scraping Agent (browse and extract info from URLs)

See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
